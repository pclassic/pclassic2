        <Accordion.Header>Does an adult need to come?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        We ask that each school has an adult chaperone. That person doesn't need to 
        be a teacher - it can be a parent or other involved person - but we need 
        someone to be responsible for getting everyone here and then back home. 
        Please email us if this would be an issue; we've made exceptions for 
        special cases in the past.

        <Accordion.Header>How many people should I bring?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        At least two; teams should be at least two people, but are generally four. Most schools bring 2-3 teams, but many also bring 5 or 6. If you're 
        thinking about bringing more than 6 teams, please email us so we can discuss it.
