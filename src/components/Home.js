          <Text>Founded in 1998, PClassic emerged as an annual programming competition tailored for high school students, organized by the Penn's PClassic Organizer Team.
            After many years, PClassic introduced a beginner-focused novice division, alongside the decision to host PClassic biannually (Fall and Spring). 
            Recently, attendance rate has risen to 300+ participants and organizers each event, making PClassic one of Pennslvania's largest competitive programming competitions.
